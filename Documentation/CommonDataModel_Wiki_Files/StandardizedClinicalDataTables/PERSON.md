The Person Domain contains records that uniquely identify each patient in the source data who is time at-risk to have clinical observations recorded within the source systems.

### Conventions 

  * All tables representing patient-related Domains have a foreign-key reference to the person_id field in the PERSON table.
  * Each person record has associated demographic attributes which are assumed to be constant for the patient throughout the course of their periods of observation. For example, the location or gender is expected to have a unique value per person, even though in life these data may change over time. 
  * Valid Gender, Race and Ethnicity Concepts each belong to their own Domain.
  * Ethnicity in the OMOP CDM follows the OMB Standards for Data on Race and Ethnicity: Only distinctions between Hispanics and Non-Hispanics are made. 
  * Additional information is stored through references to other tables, such as the home address (location_id) or the primary care provider.
  * The Provider refers to the primary care provider (General Practitioner).
  * The Care Site refers to where the Provider typically provides the primary care.
